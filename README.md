# Sunrise React

Sunrise React is a collaborative project undertaken during our bootcamp's user interface module. It served as an opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience in working with teams and utilizing GitHub for collaborative development. The project was inspired by a resort in Sri Lanka, and we used HTML, SCSS, and Bootstrap for its implementation.

## Purpose

The primary goal of the Sunrise React project was to provide students with practical experience in team collaboration and version control using Git and GitHub. Additionally, it aimed to reinforce the concepts learned during the user interface module by applying them to a real-world scenario.

## Features

- **HTML Structure**: The project follows a well-structured HTML layout, ensuring semantic markup for accessibility and SEO.
- **SCSS Styling**: SCSS is used for styling, allowing for modularity and maintainability in the project's CSS codebase.
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Bootstrap is utilized for rapid prototyping and responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
