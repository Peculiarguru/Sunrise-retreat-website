          <li>Groundswells</li>
          <p>
            Groundswells are a type of ocean wave that are known for their
            powerful, rolling swell and long distances. Groundswells are created
            by distant storms and can travel thousands of miles across the open
            ocean before reaching the shore. With their steady, building energy
            and consistent size, groundswells are a favorite among surfers for
            their challenging and exhilarating ride. These waves offer an
            unforgettable experience, as surfers carve down their faces and feel
            the rush of gliding across the water. Whether you're an experienced
            surfer or a beach-goer watching from the shore, groundswells are a
            stunning display of the ocean's raw power and beauty.

          <li>Windswells</li>
          <p>
            Windswells are a type of ocean wave created by the wind blowing over
            the surface of the water. These waves are known for their choppy,
            fast-moving appearance and can be found in many different surf
            conditions. Windswells are often smaller in size compared to
            groundswells, but they can still provide fun and exciting rides for
            surfers. These waves are characterized by their quick, playful
            energy and offer a unique challenge for surfers looking to test
            their skills. Whether you're a seasoned surfer or just watching from
            the shore, windswells are a thrilling and dynamic display of the
            ocean's power and beauty.

          <li>Shortboards</li>
          <p>
            Shortboards range in length from 5' to 7'. They have nose rocker (an
            upturned nose) to help you avoid burying the tip of your board under
            water (pearling), and possess two to four fins that allow for quick,
            radical turns.

          <li>Longboards</li>
          <p>
            Longboards are best suitable for a long surfing session without
            getting too tired, especially if one doesn't have so much experience
            catching and paddling for waves, because it does not require such
            strength to catch the wave or paddle back to the peak, as with a
            shortboard.

            Image result for what is foundboard surfing Bodyboarding has a much
            easier learning curve than surfing and is physically less demanding,
            partly because you're prone instead of required to “pop up” into
            your surf stance and balance standing on a board on a moving wave.
